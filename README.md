Welcome to this simple repository holding all the code that was used to create a Chess engine fully functional in Java, it comes fully functional and you can download the game and play it by yourself in the releases page!

As well, you can download, clone or fork this repository. Everything you see here it is open-sourced and everyone can leave a comment.

## Installation

Most likely if you want to use modify code I would recommend cloning the repository. I use IntelliJ for this project but you're welcomed to use any other Java IDE. 

```
git clone https://github.com/sharkyboy-official/chess-game-java.git
cd chess-game-java
```

And that would be everything!
